# First Step
  #Populate numbered black squares

# Pre-processing
  # 1. [] list of white squares
  # 2. [] list of numbered squares
  # 3. [] list of lights?

# Initial Population
  # Set each numbered space w/ appropriate amt of lights

# Fitness
  # Check whether their are conflicts w/ lights
  

# Loop while not fitness

  #Selection
    #Get first fittest
    #Get second fittest
  
  #Crossover
    #Find Crossover point
    #Swap values between first- and second- fittest
  
  #Mutation
    #Pick random numbered space to mutate
    #Pick new configuration for lights

  #Fitness
    # Check whether their are conflicts w/ lights

# Send fit population to second step

# Second Step
  #Populate white squares not besides numbered black squares

# Pre-processing
  #Filter out white spaces besides numbered spaces

# Initial Population
  #Place lights in available white spaces

# Fitness
  #Verify Solution
    #Verify white spaces are yellow
    #Verify light spaces (found in this step) have no conflicts

# Loop

  #Selection
    #Get first fittest
    #Get second fittest
    
  #Crossover
    #Find Crossover point
    #Swap values between first- and second- fittest

  #Mutation
    #Pick random numbered space to mutate
    #Pick new configuration for lights
